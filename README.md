**NOTE**: *This version of otr4j is in active development for the adoption of the [OTRv4][OTRv4] specification that is being developed at this moment.*

The repository for otr4j OTRv4 development is [github.com/otr4j/otr4j](https://github.com/otr4j/otr4j).

__update__ revoked a GPG subkey on a hardware-token that disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Actions were taken immediately. This is the latest thing in a long series of harassment.

## Status

- __operational__: OTRv4 interactive: confidentiality, authentication (SMP),  backwards-compatible with OTR version 3
- __feature-incomplete__, missing: managing skipped encryption keys for out-of-order message handling, non-interactive session initiation, client-profile renewals during continuous execution, … (see _checklist_ below for details)
- __in development__: _not reviewed_, _not widely adopted_ yet.

_Under consideration_:

- ⁉️ single method introduced for signaling any event that `OtrEngineHost` handles:  
The method `<T> void onEvent(SessionID sessionID, InstanceTag receiver, Event<T> event, T payload);` as single method that receives all events defined in the `Event<T>` type. This is an experiment with advantages and disadvantages.

## otr4j

This is a fork of the [original otr4j](https://github.com/jitsi/otr4j). The original otr4j started development as an GSoC 2009 project. A few years ago, a attempt was made to create a "community-friendly fork" of otr4j with the intention to lower the barrier for contribution: it is not required to sign a CLA.

This repository contains the community-friendly fork with the addition of significant refactoring effort and recently the addition of [OTRv4][OTRv4] support. [OTRv4][OTRv4] is [still in draft](<https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4/issues/230> "Checking status as there has been a long communication silence ..."). The implementation of this otr4j implementation itself is not stable (or secure).

NOTE: another security protocol [MLS] is in development and has overlapping characteristics with OTRv4.

## Progress

Current work should be considered __at most__ _prototype-quality._ The development follows the _master_ branch of [OTRv4], but may lag behind in areas that currently lack development focus.

__Development stages__:

_Note: temporary dependency on [gitlab.com/cobratbq/joldilocks][joldilocks]: see bottom of README.md_

- ✔ Minimal working encryption (Interactive DAKE, message encryption/decryption, self-serving)  
- ✔ Socialist Millionaire's Protocol for OTRv4.
- ✔ Migrate OTRv4 DAKE state machine into OTRv4 Message state machine.
- ✔ Redesigned Double Ratchet algorithm.
- ⏳ Migrate Ed448-Goldilocks and EdDSA implementation to Bouncy Castle.  
  _Requires additions to the BouncyCastle API, as certain necessary operations are not currently supplied._
  - ✔ EdDSA (the long-term keypair)
  - ❓ ECDH operations
  - ❓ Basic Scalar-based and Point-based arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication. (ring signatures, SMP)
- ✔ Process OTRv4 data-messages provisionally: until a message is successfully authenticated (and decrypted) changes cannot be permanent.  
  ⚠️ _OTRv4 requires processing_ ratchet ID, message ID, _next_ ECDH public key, _next_ DH public key _of the data message before authenticity can be established._ ⚠️
- ⏳ Support for skipped messages and store skipped message keys.
- ⏳ OTRv4 maintenance tasks (<s>session expiration timer</s>, <s>heartbeat timer</s>, refreshing client profile)  
    - TODO consider actual requirements: long-running application that needs to refresh as periodic action in its execution seems far-fetched with 2-week valid profiles. 
- ⏳ Full implementation of "OTRv3-compatible" + "OTRv4 Interactive".
- ✔ [Reproducible build][maven-reproducible-builds]  
  (`mvn -o clean install && mvn -o clean verify artifact:compare -DskipTests`)
- Clean up OTRv2 support.
- Clean up remaining TODOs
- Review and clean up logging statements. Ensure that no secret data is exposed through logging.
- Review and clean up comments to spot out-of-date quotes from the spec.

## Architectural considerations

Architectural constraints that are respected in the design.

1. Correctness of protocol (and) implementation.
1. Encapsulation of cryptographic material to prevent mistakes, misuse, excessive exposure.
1. Design that prevents or makes obvious programming errors.
1. Simplicity: restricted implementation to only as much complexity and abstraction as needed.

## Using otr4j

_Note: otr4j with OTRv4 support is not backwards-compatible with older releases. Although the API has not changed significantly, some restructuring has been performed and the interfaces extended to be able to support client requirements of OTRv4._

The easiest way to start adoption of this new version given an earlier implementation of otr4j is already in use:

1. Throw away existing imports and import types as _many of the existing types_ have moved to the `net.java.otr4j.api` package.
1. Extend your implementation of `net.java.otr4j.api.OtrEngineHost` with the additional methods that are now required.
1. Fix any other syntactic failures / build failures. The javadoc on the various methods should clearly describe the method's API and expectations. If this is not the case, file a bug as this should be expected.  
   _As there are new features and upgraded cryptographic primitives in OTRv4, upgrading will not be effortless. However it should be possible to do a basic conversion in a reasonable amount of time._

    <summary>Checklist</summary>

__Functionality__

- General Off-the-record operation:
  - ☑ Maintain mixed OTRv2, OTRv3, OTRv4 sessions.
  - ☑ Persistent instance tags
  - ☑ 'Interactive DAKE' implemented as Message states i.s.o. AKE states.
  - ☑ OTRv4 extension to OTR error messages
  - ☑ Periodic heartbeat messages
  - [Queuing up messages](message-queueing.md) while not in `ENCRYPTED_MESSAGES` state.
    - ☑ Basic message queueing implemented. (Cannot fully work until Double Ratchet algorithm is implemented.)
    - ☐ Message queueing configurable.  
        _This may be important as queue is flushed onto instance with first established private messaging. This may not always be desirable._
  - Client profiles:
    - ☑ Publishing of generated `ClientProfile` payloads through callback to `OtrEngineHost` (Affects _Deniability_-property.)
    - ☐ Timely refreshing Client Profile payload (due to expiration / updated Client Profile parameters)
  - ☐ Strictly isolate OTRv3 and OTRv4 interactions: only accept OTRv2/3 messages in `START`, but not in any OTRv4 state, and vice versa. Separate `FINISH` states for OTRv2/3 and OTRv4.
  - ☐ OTRv4 operating modes (OTRv3-compatible, OTRv4-standalone, OTRv4-interactive-only).
- Cryptographic primitives:
  - Ed448-Goldilocks elliptic curve
    - ☑ Temporary working solution
    - ☑ Migrate to BouncyCastle `>= 1.60`.
  - 3072-bit Diffie-Hellman
    - ☑ Temporary working solution
    - ☐ Verify if current solution is acceptable, otherwise migrate to JCA/BC
  - ☑ ChaCha20 symmetric cipher
  - ☑ SHAKE-256
  - ☑ Ring signatures
- Key Exchange:
  - ☑ Interactive DAKE
  - ☐ Non-interactive DAKE
- Key Management:
  - Double Ratchet:
    - ☑ Generate next message keys (in-order messages)
    - ☑ Generate future message keys (skip over missing messages)
    - ☑ Implementation of Double Ratchet algorithm redesign.
  - Shared secrets management:
    - ☑ Ephemeral DH with 3072-bit parameters
    - ☑ Ephemeral ECDH based on Ed448-Goldilocks
    - ☑ Key rotation
  - ☑ Calculate _Encryption_, _MAC_ and _Extra Symmetric Key_ keys
  - ☑ Revealing used MAC keys
  - ☑ Revealing queued up MAC keys upon session expiration.
  - ☐ Revealing MAC keys generated from memorized message keys upon session expiration.
  - ☐ Periodic clean-up of "old" skipped message keys
- Message encryption/decryption:
  - ☑ In-order messages
  - ☑ In-order messages with some messages missing
  - ☑ Out-of-order messages
- Fragmentation and re-assembly:
  - ☑ Fragmentation
  - ☑ Re-assembling fragmented messages
  - ☐ Periodic clean-up of "old" fragments
- Socialist Millionaire's Protocol:
  - ☑ OTRv2/OTRv3
  - ☑ OTRv4
- Client and PreKey Profiles:
  - ☑ Client Profile support
  - ☐ PreKey Profile support
- Extra Symmetric Key support:
  - ☑ OTRv3
  - ☑ OTRv4
- API support:
  - ☑ Verify if API still fully suitable for clients to adopt.
  - ☑ Ability to import/export DSA and EdDSA key pairs, such that `ClientProfile`s can be persisted/restored.
  - ☐ `OtrKeyManager` was removed. Evaluate whether this is a problem for adopters. (I prefer to leave it out or put it in its own repository.)
- Interoperability (limited testing):
  - ☑ backwards-compatible with Jitsi's otr4j implementation (for OTR version 3 support)
  - ☐ testing against other OTRv4 implementations
- Misc
  - ☑ Set flag `IGNORE_UNREADABLE` also for OTRv3 DISCONNECT and all SMP messages.  
  _Although not explicitly document that this is necessary, it should not break any existing applications. This makes implementations of OTRv3 and OTRv4 more similar and promotes better behavior in general, being: the other party is not needlessly warned for (lost) messages that do not contain valuable content, i.e. they are part of the OTR process, but do not contain user content themselves._
  - ☐ Ability to define own, customized-per-network `phi` (shared session state) implementer addition for the `t` value calculation.  
  _Under consideration as part of the [OTRv4 client implementation recommendations](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4-client-imp-recommendations/issues/3)._
  - ☐ Evaluate whether there really is an advantage to having `OtrEngineHost` calls specify a session instance. (Does it make sense to make the distinction?)
  - ☐ Evaluate cases of `OtrException` being thrown. Reduce number of cases where user has to handle an exception without there being a real resolution.
  - ☐ Protect access to critical data for internal use in `otr4j`/`joldilocks`. (Previously Java's `SecurityManager`, possibly Java 9+ module support.)

__Operational__

- ☑ [PGP-signature verification maven plug-in](https://github.com/s4u/pgpverify-maven-plugin) for verification of dependencies and build plug-ins according to [predefined public keys mapping](../pgpkeys.list).
- Constant-time implementations:
  - ☑ MAC key comparison
  - ☑ Point and Scalar equality
  - ☑ Scalar value comparison
  - ☑ Ring signatures
- Cleaning up data:
  - ☑ Clearing byte-arrays containing sensitive material after use.
  - ☐ Clean up remaining message keys instances when transitioning away from encrypted message states.
  - ☐ Investigate effectiveness of clearing byte-arrays right before potential GC. (Maybe they are optimized away by JVM?)
- Verify OTR-protocol obligations of other party:
  - ☑ Verify that revealed MAC keys are present when expected. (I.e. is list of revealed MAC keys larger than 0 bytes?)
- In-memory representation of points and scalar values as byte-arrays:  
  _Note that we specifically refer to how the data is represented in memory. Operations require temporary conversion back and forth into an intermediate type._
  - ☑ Points kept as byte-arrays.
  - ☑ Scalar values kept as byte-arrays.
- Mathematical operations act on byte-array representations directly:  
  _See also [BearSSL big integer operations](<https://www.bearssl.org/bigint.html>)_
  - ☐ Scalar arithmetic operations
  - ☐ Point arithmetic operations
- Robustness
  - ☑ otr4j does not handle Error-type exceptions.  
  _If critical situations occur, for instance `OutOfMemoryError`, then all bets are off._
  - ☑ otr4j protects itself against `RuntimeException`s caused by callbacks into the host application.
  _Any occurrence of a `RuntimeException` is considered a bug on the host application side, and is caught and logged by otr4j._
- Concurrency:
  - ☑ Thread-safety with granularity of single master with its slave sessions.  
      Messages from different contacts can be processed concurrently. Messages from same contact different clients, are forced to sequential processing.
- Stability
  - ☐ Library in execution performance profiling.
  - ☐ Measure memory usage changes under long-term use/heavy load.
- OTRv3 - catching up:
  - ☐ In-memory representation for OTRv3.
  - ☐ Arithmetical operations on byte-arrays for OTRv2 and/or OTRv3 logic.
- ☑ Make builds of _otr4j_ reproducible.

__Developmental__

- ☑ Java assertions (`-ea`) provide additional sanity-checks to detect concerning cases such as working with all-zero byte-arrays early.
- ☐ Support Java 7+ to be compatible with Android.  
  _Reevaluate requirements, given Java 9+ modules, newer Android versions, etc._
- ☑ Encapsulate cryptographic material such that design facilitates appropriate use and maintenance.
- ☑ States, such as Message states, isolated as to prevent mistakes in mixing up variables and state management for different states.
- ☑ Use of exceptions to force alternative control flow paths for verification/validation failures.
- ☑ Use of identity checks to ensure we do not compare an instance/byte-array with itself.
- ☑ Strategically placed assertions to discover mistakes such as uninitialized/cleared byte-arrays.
- Tool support:
  - ☑ JSR-305 annotations for static analysis
  - ☑ Introduce compiler warnings failure at build-time
  - ☑ Introduce pmd analysis at build-time.
  - ☑ Introduce SpotBugs analysis at build-time
  - ☑ Introduce checkstyle at build-time to guard formatting/style
  - ☑ Introduce checkstyle _ImportControl_ module to guard the design structure
  - ☑ Introduce [ErrorProne](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation).
  - ☑ Introduce thread-safety verified by static analysis. ([ErrorProne: @GuardedBy annotation](https://github.com/google/error-prone/blob/master/annotations/src/main/java/com/google/errorprone/annotations/concurrent/GuardedBy.java))
  - ☑ Introduce [NullAway](https://github.com/uber/NullAway) for compile-time nullability checking. Defaults to _non-null_ by default.
  - ☐ Introduce [Animal sniffer](https://www.mojohaus.org/animal-sniffer/) build plug-in to verify that we do not break backwards-compatibility, once released.
  - ☒ Experiment with features of [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org).  
    _Most important cases are covered._
  - ☒ spotbugs-annotations to support managing clean-up of cryptographic key material  
    _Google Error-Prone annotations prove to be more interesting. Adoption of those annotations has started already._
- ☑ Significant amount of unit tests to accompany the library. (Currently: 1300+)  
  _Most prevalent and relevant cases are covered. `SessionTest` contains tests at the API-layer for typical cases and special cases, such as for the injection of malicious messages with similar counters and public keys substituted._

</details>

## Limitations

- _otr4j supports message lengths up to 2^31._  
  Message sizes in OTR are defined as 4-byte _unsigned_. Due to Java's signed integer types, this implementation currently uses a signed integer. Therefore, the highest bit of the message length is interpreted as sign bit. Lengths over 2^31 are unsupported.
- _otr4j assumes message injections onto the (chat) network always succeed._  
  It is expected that message injection always succeeds. There is no way to signal that it failed and otr4j does not have any countermeasures in case it fails. (This may be added as a feature, but is currently not under consideration.)

## Contributing / Help needed

Please open an issue to discuss contributions early. As OTRv4 is still in draft and work on otr4j is active, things might change quickly.

- Peer-reviewing (for correctness, security and improvements in general)  
  _Don't trust me. I have done most of the work, so you can contribute the fixes to make it more trustworthy._
- Integration into chat clients
  - adoption
  - feedback on the API from the user perspective

## Build support and code style

The code is built using maven. The build configuration fails on compiler warnings and performs several types of static analysis. Checkstyle verifies the coding style and the same checkstyle configuration file can be used to configure your IDE. Although this does not catch all potential issues, I hope it will serve to provide early feedback for code contributions.

In addition to syntactic correctness checking, we enforce javadoc for anything that is part of the public API: _public_ and _protected_ classes methods and fields. The rationale is that the user of otr4j should expect reasonable information on the logic its able to call. Although some javadoc may still be limited in usefulness, we should aim to use it to clarify everything the user should know in using otr4j.

## Setting up your IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

1. Load the otr4j `pom.xml` file as a maven module (project).
1. Load `codecheck/checkstyle.xml` as the code style in IntelliJ (you will need to have the Checkstyle plug-in installed)
1. ... (I'm not sure if anything else is needed, but I'll update when I find out.)

## Dependency on [joldilocks][joldilocks]

Due to initial lack of support for Ed448-Goldilocks, a _very_ basic, limited Java library was written to support Ed448-Goldilocks. This library is by no means production-ready, does not provide any of the operational requirements necessary for security purposes and is not even guaranteed to be functionally correct. It did however enable further implementation of otr4j. We aim to completely migrate away from _joldilocks_ for otr4j. At most, we may keep it as a second opinion in unit testing code. _joldilocks_ needs Java 9 to compile so this dependency also raises our minimum required Java version for otr4j.

## Misc

- __2023-12-01__ Subkey revoked.
- __2019-10-28__ Due to third-party contributions made under dubious circumstances, i.e. possibly made during working time instead of personal time, some merges in the commit history have been redone. There are no longer any third-party contributions in the OTRv4 work. The [original master-branch content][original-master] is still available.
